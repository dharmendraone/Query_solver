🌟 Overview

Query Solver is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the way students connect with teachers for real-time assistance. Leveraging the power of WebRTC, this platform enables seamless peer-to-peer communication, allowing students to get their doubts resolved instantly and effectively.

🚀 The Challenge

In today’s fast-paced educational environment, students often struggle to find immediate help for their questions. Delays in getting answers can hinder learning, and sometimes, students forget their queries by the time they receive support. This gap sparked the idea for a solution that fosters direct interaction between students and knowledgeable educators.

💡 Our Solution

Query Solver bridges the communication gap by creating a dynamic platform where students can easily reach out to teachers, similar to social media interactions. Here’s how it works:

Request Assistance: Students can specify the subject area of their inquiry and send requests to teachers specializing in that domain.

Real-Time Interaction: Once a teacher accepts a request, they engage in a live video call, providing personalized support to resolve the student’s doubt.

Focused Sessions: Each interaction is one-on-one, ensuring that students receive dedicated attention for their queries.

✨ Key Features

User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for both students and teachers.

Instant Video Communication: Experience seamless video calls powered by WebRTC technology.

Live Chat: Communicate via text chat alongside video calls for enhanced interaction.

Screen Sharing: Teachers can share their screens during sessions to provide visual explanations and guidance.

Subject-Specific Connections: Easily connect with teachers based on the specific topic or subject matter. Admin Panel: A dedicated admin interface for managing users, monitoring sessions, and overseeing platform activity.

Personalized Attention: One-on-one sessions ensure that every student feels heard and supported.
